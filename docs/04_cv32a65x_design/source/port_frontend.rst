Due to cv32a65x configuration, some ports are tied to a static value. These ports do not appear in the above table, they are listed below

| For any HW configuration,
|   ``flush_bp_i`` input is tied to 0
| As DebugEn = 0,
|   ``debug_mode_i`` input is tied to 0
|   ``set_debug_pc_i`` input is tied to 0
