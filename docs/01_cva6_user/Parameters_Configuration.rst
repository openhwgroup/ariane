Parameters and Configuration
============================

Parameters
----------
We start with a table of parameters as they have an impact on almost all subsequent sections.
Suggestion to use the SystemVerilog names of the parameters (instead of another convention) as a reference. We need to make a link between parameters and their impact on the supported extensions.
Jean-Roch said he has something.

Configurations
--------------
A configuration is a fixed set of parameters.
We list the parameters of the configuration for which verification activities have started.
Give step 1 configuration (Jean-Roch?)
