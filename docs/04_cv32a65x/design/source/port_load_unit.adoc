|===
Due to cv32a65x configuration, some ports are tied to a static value. These ports do not appear in the above table, they are listed below

As RVH = False,::
*   `tinst_o` output is tied to 0
*   `hs_ld_st_inst_o` output is tied to 0
*   `hlvx_inst_o` output is tied to 0
For any HW configuration,::
*   `dtlb_hit_i` input is tied to 1
As MMUPresent = 0,::
*   `dtlb_ppn_i` input is tied to 0
