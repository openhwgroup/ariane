## [Unreleased]

### 4.0.0

### Added

- Commit log feature
- Support for A-Extension
- Preliminary FP support
- Preliminary support for OpenPiton cache system

### Changed

- core_id / cluster_id inputs have been merged to hard_id input

### 3.0.0

### Added

- Added RISC-V compliant debug (interface changes)
- Implemented basic re-naming

### Changed

- [Bugfix] Cache-refill AXI logic (AXI protocol violation)
- [Bugfix] `MSTATUS` write-able through `SSTATUS` #65
- [Bugfix] PTW has protocol violation #61
- [Bugfix] Race-condition #54
- Removed timer input. Access to mtime will trap and must be handled by M-mode SW.

### 2.0.2 - 2018-04-08

### Changed

- Bugfix in flush behaviour of cache #34
- Pumped submodules

### 2.0.1 - 2018-01-26

### Added

- Improved instruction fetch fronten-end
- Add RAS
- Add support for Bender hardware management

### Changed

- Bugfix in non-detected illegal instruction #12
- Bugfix in non-detected illegal instruction JALR (funct3 != 0)
- Bugfix in non-detected illegal instruction FENCE (some bit-checks missing)

### 2.0.0 - 2018-01-26

### Added

- Instruction cache added
- Support for Verilator

### Changed

- CI support for verilator
- Update documentation

### 1.0.0 - 2018-01-17

### Added

- Non-blocking data cache
- Two AXI interfaces on top level, one for bypassing and one for actual cache-able regions
- Performance Counters
- Hardware multiplication (full M-Extension)
- Support for inter processor interrupts (IPI)

### Changed

- Testbench: EOC component now listening on store interface only
- Store interfaces has been simplified by removing the `valid` signal, a transaction is now considered finished as soon as the dcache gives the grant signal.
- EOC and dcache checker has been reworked to get rid of absolute path in UVM testbench
- Fix problem when bypassing the data cache

### 0.4.0 - 2017-10-13

Linux booting on FPGA.

### Added
- Support for M Extension (mul, div and reminder) in simulation
- Preliminary debug support
- Added support for cache management instructions

### Changed
- Various bug fixes (branch-prediction, PTW and TLB problems, interrupt handling)
- Fixed synthesis issues

## [0.3.0] - 2017-07-15

### Added
- Added support for device tree in Ariane's testbench

### Changed
- Bugfixes in compressed decoder (legal shifts where throwing an illegal instruction although they where legal)
- Increase memory size to 16 MB in-order to simulate a full Linux boot
- Re-worked timer facilities in the CSR section, moved to a platform RTC
- Core completed its first full Linux boot
- Changelog design, adhering to a common [standard](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [0.2.0] - 2017-06-28

### Added
- Virtual memory support according to RISC-V privilege specification 1.11 (WIP)
- Add support for Torture test framework

### Changed
- IPC improvements
- Timing improvements
- New fetch interface, smaller and ready for macro-op fusion and dual-issue

## [0.1.0] - 2017-06-21

### Added
- Initial development, getting to a stable point
